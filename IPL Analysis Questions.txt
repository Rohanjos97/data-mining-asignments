innings:

1. year-wise is there any effect of first team batting: P(win/lose) depends on inning?

batsman/ bowler:

1. strike rate (runs per balls)

2. highest/lowest run per match/ total runs in a series/ overall(avg run rate/yr)

3. performace of player every year, then compare if it is impacted due to change in team, or retained in same team

4. effective bowler against top performing batsman/ how batsman is dismissed from field( wicket-to-wicket/ side-to-side what kind of strategy to use against them based on dismissal)

5. death bowler specialist

6. best Economy of the bowler: Run scored / (No. of ball bowled by bowler / 6).

7. Wicket taking ability: No. of balls bowled / Wicket taken.

8. Consistency: Run conceded / Wicket taken.


additional analysis of the game:

1. (STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION)which teams won against which other team and how many times...(used to predict next match outcome)

2. effective opener, chaser, closing-bowler, closing-batsman(overall year wise)

3. P(winning the game) based on total runs in a powerplay(3)

4. best opening partnership

5. top 10 players(bowler/ batsmen/ fielder) season-wise & overall IPL record

6. highest 6/4 by each player per season
(can find any correlation between 5 & 6?)

7. how many times does chasing team has won the match

8. which team scored 200+ against other team

9. highest scoring(batsman/ bower) player's impact in team

10. (STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION)(**DIFFICULT, come to this at last) does change in position make peroramnce of a batter better than before

11. Hard-hitting batsman = (Fours + Sixes) / Ball played by batsman

12. highest consecutive sixes (6 sixes, 5 sixes, 4 sixes...) in an over: info about the player / most hattricks in 
a season

13. longest overs bowled in IPL

14. Consistency of Player: Total Run / No. of times out.

15. Running b/w the wickets: (Total run – (Fours + Sixes)) / (total ball played – boundry balls). (If this fourth 
metric is better in batsman than the hard-hitting metrics, then you can easily guess that he is not good at hitting boundaries but is good at getting singles, twos, and threes on other balls.)
